                    in the code, they will show up on <em>separate lines </em>in the browser.

                <p> Coding this page reminds me of the very first HTML website that I created for 
                    <a href="http://www.lookn4marketing.com">Look'N4 Marketing</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Well that's all I have to say for now in order to test my basic understanding of the HTML anatomy.</p>
