                    This is the first paragraph of Aaron's Bootcamp Webpage. Following this paragraph,
                    Aaron has included an image of himself.
                </p>
                <img src="aaron-bootcamp/images/Aaron_Profile_Photo.png" alt="Aaron's Profile Photo">
                <p> Three things I like about my profile photo are (listed in an unordered list):
                    <ul>
                        <li> The color of my shirt</li>
                        <li> How the image is cropped</li>
                        <li> The beautiful Seattle background</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p> If I listed this 3 things in an ordered list, it will look like this:
                    <ol>
                        <li> The color of my shirt</li>
                        <li> How the image is cropped</li>
                        <li> The beautiful Seattle background</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p> Coding this page reminds me of the very first HTML website that I created for 
                    <a href="http://www.lookn4marketing.com">Look'N4 Marketing</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Well that's all I have to say for now in order to test my basic understanding of the HTML anatomy.</p>
